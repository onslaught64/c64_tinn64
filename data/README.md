Datafiles directory is here!


## Step 1: Download Training Data
Download the following files to the `test/` directory (this directory) 
* https://storage.cloud.google.com/quickdraw_dataset/full/numpy_bitmap/cat.npy
* https://storage.cloud.google.com/quickdraw_dataset/full/numpy_bitmap/coffee%20cup.npy
* https://storage.cloud.google.com/quickdraw_dataset/full/numpy_bitmap/computer.npy
* https://storage.cloud.google.com/quickdraw_dataset/full/numpy_bitmap/police%20car.npy
* https://storage.cloud.google.com/quickdraw_dataset/full/numpy_bitmap/teddy-bear.npy
* https://storage.cloud.google.com/quickdraw_dataset/full/numpy_bitmap/underwear.npy
* https://storage.cloud.google.com/quickdraw_dataset/full/numpy_bitmap/snake.npy

* https://storage.cloud.google.com/quickdraw_dataset/full/numpy_bitmap/submarine.npy
* https://storage.cloud.google.com/quickdraw_dataset/full/numpy_bitmap/toilet.npy

Unfortunately you need a Google login to download these files, so I can't just automate the process for you. :( 


## Step 2: Convert the files to trining dataset
type `make convert` from the root of the repository and wait some time for the training set to be completed


See main README for complete documentation.
